## Introduction
Exercism is an online platform that offers coding exercises for over 50 programming languages. It provides a fantastic way for programmers to improve their skills in different languages and get feedback from mentors.

This repository is a community-driven effort to share solutions to Exercism exercises in the languages Go, Rust, and Zig. Whether you're a beginner or an expert in these languages, this playground welcomes everyone to explore, contribute, and learn from each other's solutions.

## Languages
The Exercism Solutions Playground focuses on the following programming languages:

- Go
- Rust
- Zig <br>
  
If you're interested in any of these languages or want to improve your skills, this playground is the perfect place for you!

## Getting Started
To get started with the Exercism Solutions Playground, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```

```

2. Choose the language you want to work on and navigate to the respective directory:
- For Go solutions: cd go
- For Rust solutions: cd rust
- For Zig solutions: cd zig <br>
Inside the language directory, you'll find subdirectories for each exercise. Pick an exercise you want to work on, and start coding!

3. After solving an exercise, you can share your solution by creating a new branch and submitting a pull request.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized into three main directories, each corresponding to a specific programming language.
```yml
TriLangPlayground/
├── go/         # Go solutions
│   ├── exercise1/
│   ├── exercise2/
│   └── ...
